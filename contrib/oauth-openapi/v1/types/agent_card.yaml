  The AgentCard is a self-describing manifest for an agent. It provides essential
  metadata including the agent's identity, capabilities, skills, supported
  communication methods, and security requirements.
properties:
  additionalInterfaces:
    description: |-
      A list of additional supported interfaces (transport and URL combinations).
      This allows agents to expose multiple transports, potentially at different URLs.

      Best practices:
      - SHOULD include all supported transports for completeness
      - SHOULD include an entry matching the main 'url' and 'preferredTransport'
      - MAY reuse URLs if multiple transports are available at the same endpoint
      - MUST accurately declare the transport available at each URL

      Clients can select any interface from this list based on their transport capabilities
      and preferences. This enables transport negotiation and fallback scenarios.

  capabilities:
    "$ref": "#/definitions/AgentCapabilities"
    description: A declaration of optional capabilities supported by the agent.
  defaultInputModes:
    description: |-
      Default set of supported input MIME types for all skills, which can be
      overridden on a per-skill basis.
    items:
      type: string
    type: array
  defaultOutputModes:
    description: |-
      Default set of supported output MIME types for all skills, which can be
      overridden on a per-skill basis.

  description:
    description: |-
      A human-readable description of the agent, assisting users and other agents
      in understanding its purpose.
    examples:
      - Agent that helps users with recipes and cooking.
    type: string
  documentationUrl:
    description: An optional URL to the agent's documentation.
    type: string
  iconUrl:
    description: An optional URL to an icon for the agent.
    type: string
  name:
    description: A human-readable name for the agent.
    examples:
      - Recipe Agent
    type: string
  preferredTransport:
    default: JSONRPC
    description: |-
      The transport protocol for the preferred endpoint (the main 'url' field).
      If not specified, defaults to 'JSONRPC'.

      IMPORTANT: The transport specified here MUST be available at the main 'url'.
      This creates a binding between the main URL and its supported transport protocol.
      Clients should prefer this transport and URL combination when both are supported.
    examples:
      - JSONRPC
      - GRPC
      - HTTP+JSON
    type: string
  protocolVersion:
    default: 0.3.0
    description: The version of the A2A protocol this agent supports.
    type: string
  provider:
    "$ref": "#/definitions/AgentProvider"
    description: Information about the agent's service provider.
  security:
    description: |-
      A list of security requirement objects that apply to all agent interactions. Each object
      lists security schemes that can be used. Follows the OpenAPI 3.0 Security Requirement Object.
      This list can be seen as an OR of ANDs. Each object in the list describes one possible
      set of security requirements that must be present on a request. This allows specifying,
      for example, "callers must either use OAuth OR an API Key AND mTLS."
    examples:
      - - oauth:
            - read
        - api-key: []
          mtls: []

      to authenticated users. Defaults to false.
